This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Load a bunch of packages
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(readr)
```

Embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Generate new data:

```{r}

cars_data <- read_csv("data/data.csv")

new_cars_data <- cars_data %>%
  mutate(average_dist = speed/dist)

# save new file in output

write_csv(new_cars_data,"output/generated_data.csv")

```
